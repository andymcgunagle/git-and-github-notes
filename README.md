# Git & GitHub Notes

## Git Notes

### Git Docs

https://git-scm.com/docs

### Init & Status

- Do not initialize a git repository inside an existing git repository (use `git status` to verify you're not currently inside an existing repo before running `git init`).

### Adding/Staging & Unstaging

- `git add <file>`: Stage specific updated files in the *working directory* to the *staging area* before committing them to the git *repository*.

- `git add .`: Stage all updated files in the working directory at once.

- `git restore --staged <file>`: Unstage specific files from the staging area.

- `git reset`: Unstage all files from the staging area.

### Restoring

- `git restore .` or `git restore <file>`: Discard changes to all files or specific files in the working directory. If a path is tracked but does not exist in the restore source, it will be removed to match the source.

- Note the difference in actions when the `--staged` flag is not used.

### Committing

- `git commit -m "My commit message..."`: The commit message should summarize the changes in that commit.

- Try to keep each commit focused on a single thing. This makes it easier to undo changes later on and can also make your code easier to review.

- [`git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config): Sets VS Code as your your core.editor and enables you to use `git commit` (without the `-m` flag) to open a new file in VS Code and easily compose longer commit messages there.

- `git commit -a -m "My commit message..."`: The `-a` flag automatically stages files that have been modified and deleted (without the need for `git add`). 
  - Note that new files you have not told Git about are not tracked - you'd need to include them with `git add <file>`.

### Logging

- `git log --oneline`: Shows the first line of commit messages and a shorter snippet of the 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name.

### Amending Commits

- `git commit --amend`: Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can "redo" the previous commit using the `--amend` flag. 
  - Only works for the previous commit. 
  - Will enable you to update the previous commit message.
  - If you forgot to stage files, use `git add <file>` first.

### Ignoring files

- Create a file called **.gitignore** in the root of a repository.
  - `.DS_Store` would ignore files named **.DS_Store**.
  - `folderName/` will ignore an entire directory.
  - `*.log` will ignore any files with the **.log** extension.

### Branching

- `HEAD` is a pointer that refers to the current "location" in your repository. It points to a particular branch reference.

- `git branch`: View your existing branches.
  - `*` will indicate the branch you are currently on.  

- `git branch <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch based on the current HEAD. 
  - This command does not switch HEAD to the new branch - it just creates the new branch.
  - Branch names should not include spaces.

- `git switch <branch-name>`: Once you have created a new branch, this will switch HEAD to it.
  - `git checkout <branch-name>` can also be used to switch you to a different branch. `git checkout` also does a ton of other things, so `git switch` was made for simplicity.
  - You'll need to commit or stash your changes before you switch to a divergent branch.

- `git switch -c <branch-name>`: One-liner to create and switch to the newly created branch.
